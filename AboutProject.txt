Version 1.0 Released 19 March 2013


This Codebase is for the Orange Hawk VTOL Hybrid, released March 2013. 
It compiles in Arduino 1.0 and Processing 1.5.1, using MultiWii 2.1 as the base code.
The Processing library controlP5-0.7.5 is used in the MultiWiiConf utility.

History:
In August 2011, the author, Steve, decided to pursue a life-long goal of making a VTOL dream machine.
The goal was to create an aircraft capable of hovering and VTOL operations, but with the efficiency of 
a fixed-wing aircraft. Inspiration for this project came from news clips such as the IAI Panther and 
Mini-Panther, presented on YouTube such as this example here: http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FJv-kQ2rN2c
Further, the author has been actively engaged in UAV design and experimentation for 9 years, starting with
electric R/C aircraft at age 13, and had concurrently attempted other ideas for VTOL aircraft.

Also, the efforts of "leadfeather", "cass3825", "foam and tape", "EddieWeeks" and "RCvertt" on the 
RcGroups.com VTOL forum were inspirational. Although this group developed code based on MultiWii 1.7/1.8 
for their efforts, I decided to forge ahead on my own modification of the more recent 2.1 version and try 
to keep things simple. Their code is available in various threads, and a primary version can be found at 
http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/showthread.php?t=1523814, or at 
http://www.rcgroups.com/forums/member.php?u=56274 , cass3825's blog. I've modified the MultiWiiConf 
utility for this code, and have other modifications such as a general purpose mechanism controler started.

The airframe I've constructed, called the "Orange Hawk" design, is a Tricopter Delta Wing with a Bicopter
front cassette assembly, which means that the front motors are actuated independently. Details on 
the airframe itself, including the design decision, theory, motor selections, airfoil, and other metrics
are to be detailed in a AIAA Student Conference Paper to be presented at the AIAA Region VI Student 
Conference in March 2013, and will be fully detailed after that date.

Thanks for you interest, and enjoy flying!
